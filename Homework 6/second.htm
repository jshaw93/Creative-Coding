            <h2>Thor goes fishing</h2>
            <div>
                I think my favorite story has to be from Norse mythology, telling of an adventure of Thor where he goes fishing in Hymir the giant's lake.
                As the story tells the Aesir were out of mead, the drink hoarded by Hymir for an untold reason.  Thor was chosen to take the mead back for the gods.
                Tyr, the god of war and Hymir's own son told Thor that in order to steal away Hymir's cauldrons he would need to be very cunning, much more a task
                for another god than Thor.  Thor did his best, however, disguising himself as a child named Vuer in order to enter the halls of Hymir, taking Tyr himself along with.
